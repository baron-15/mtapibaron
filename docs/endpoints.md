- **/by-id/[id],[id],[id]...**  
Returns the stations with the provided IDs, in the order provided. IDs should be comma separated with no space characters.

- **/routes**  
Lists available routes.

    "data": [
        "S",

## Terminal display fields

Station responses from `/by-id`, `/by-route`, and `/by-location` include these
fields on each train in `N`, `S`, and `alltrains`:

```json
{
    "route": "M",
    "direction": "N",
    "trip": "example-trip",
    "terminal": "G08N",
    "terminalName": "Forest Hills-71 Av",
    "directionLabel": "Uptown",
    "terminalPrimary": "Uptown & Queens",
    "terminalSecondary": "Forest Hills-71 Av via Roosevelt Island"
}
```

This example describes a train at W 4 St whose trip update includes Roosevelt
Island before Forest Hills. The same trip has different labels at later stops.

- `terminalPrimary`: the V2 headline. Recognized borough direction labels stay
  singular (for example, `Manhattan` for a Brooklyn train entering Manhattan
  before Queens). At Manhattan stops, Uptown/Downtown can add a Brooklyn or Queens
  terminal borough; Uptown can add `The Bronx`. Otherwise the raw terminal name
  is the fallback for an unrecognized direction label.
- `terminalSecondary`: the terminal name under a recognized direction heading,
  optionally followed by ` via Roosevelt Island`. It is `null` when the headline
  already supplies the terminal name, or just `via Roosevelt Island` when that
  fallback headline needs the qualifier. Clients hide a null/empty subtitle.
- `terminalName`, `terminal`, and `directionLabel`: existing destination/direction
  fields, retained without display qualifiers for older clients and audio.

The Roosevelt Island qualifier uses stop `B06` in the ordered stop updates for
that specific trip. It must be ahead of the current stop, strictly before the
terminal, and not marked `SKIPPED`. It is not added at/after Roosevelt Island,
for a Roosevelt Island terminal, or when the stop is absent from the supplied
sequence. This works for either direction and any route; it does not assume
that every F or M train uses that station. The check precedes arrival-window
and train-count limits and needs no additional feed requests. Existing `via`
text in a terminal name is left intact. Skipped stops do not receive arrivals.
